# ESP8266 AT software

This folder contains latest AT software from Espressif development repository:
https://github.com/espressif/ESP8266_NONOS_SDK

Development of ESP-AT Lib follows latest development from Espressif systems,
therefore it is sometimes necessary to make build configuration on your own,
before official release is available from Espressif.

I will post here always latest built binary file from official repository,
running on ESP8266 used for development purposes.

### `at` folder

`at` folder contains latest official release from Espressif systems and is not important for us.

### `upgrade` folder

This is the folder where latest releases of ESP8266 AT software are put,
when custom built is done using official Espressif's SDK for AT software.
